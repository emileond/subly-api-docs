## What is Subly?
Subly is a powerful platform for tracking and managing your business's financial data, including recurring expenses, revenue streams, and individual transactions.

The Subly API provides programmatic access to your workspace data, allowing you to automate workflows, build custom integrations, and sync your financial information with other services. Whether you want to automatically log new sales from your e-commerce store as revenue, pull expense data into a custom dashboard, or build your own financial tools, the API provides the flexibility you need.

## Getting an API Key

Subly uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can generate and manage your API keys through the [Subly Dashboard](https://web.subly.app/settings).

Each key is tied to your workspace, ensuring that you can only access the data you are authorized to see.

## Authentication

To authenticate your API requests, include your secret key in the `x-api-key` header of every request.

<Warning>
    Your API key is a **secret** and should be stored securely on a server. Never expose it in public repositories, client-side code, or mobile applications.
</Warning>

Here is an example of how to make an authenticated request using `curl`:

```bash
curl -X GET "[https://www.subly.app/api/v1/revenue](https://www.subly.app/api/v1/revenue)" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
